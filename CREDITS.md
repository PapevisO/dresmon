This project was inspired by various discussions and tools in the developer community. Below are some of the notable inspirations:

* **jwilder/nginx-proxy** - Automated nginx proxy for Docker containers using docker-gen. Can be seemlessly configured to run with Letsencrypt companion.
* **traefik** - A modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
* Discussions on the need for dynamic DNS resolution with Docker. Besides:
  * [How to make an entry in /etc/hosts when starting a container? - Docker Community Forums](https://forums.docker.com/t/how-to-make-an-entry-in-etc-hosts-when-starting-a-container/137806)
